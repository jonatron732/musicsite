                <h2>My experience</h2>
                <p>I am the current conductor of the Douglas County Youth Orchestra and was one of the adopters of this orchestra.  Me and a couple other parents came together to take of the orchestra when the previous director and conductor left.  Ever since then we have been able to grow the orchestra into what it is today even through covid and the challenges it brought.</p>
